# Netflix-User-Analytics-Dataset
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior, content preferences, viewing patterns, and device usage for a Netflix-style streaming platform. Using a dataset of 20 users, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how audiences interact with content, which genres they prefer, and how their binge-watching habits vary over time.

The main objective of this analysis is to understand user engagement, identify popular genres, analyze retention patterns, and discover viewing trends that can help improve content recommendations and platform performance.
